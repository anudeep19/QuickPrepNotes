JPA Tutorial notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XszpXoII9Sg

@builder -> returns the object after each setter

@AllArgConstructor -> avoids the usage of all args constructor here by adding the Lombok dependency

@Repository -> enables to add the JPA related stuff with extends JpaRepository(<Student>)

@Embeddable (to have a child class with attributes like guardingEmail, guardingName  as straignt columns in the table, use this)

@Embedded (use it for adding some object with attributes as linearly added columns in the table , here we give mapping from column name to class attribut name)

JPQL -> here the query is written based on the class and the attributes but not on the actual database table name and column name

@Query -> in spring boot jpa we annotate on the repository class's method definition, we don't need to implement it further

@oneToMany -> marking an attribute to a list as foreign key entity
